        <h2>Leaderboard Scoring</h2>
        <p>Your ranking on the leaderboard is determined by a composite score calculated using the following algorithm:</p>
        <pre>
        Composite Score = (Accuracy Score × 0.4) + (Performance Score × 0.6)
        </pre>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy Score:</strong> Measures how close your predicted score is to your actual score.
                <br><code>Accuracy Score = 1 - abs(Predicted Score - Actual Score) / Questions Attempted</code>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Performance Score:</strong> Evaluates how well you answered the questions.
                <br><code>Performance Score = (Actual Score / Questions Attempted) × Questions Attempted</code>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <P>Weights were chosen based on the idea that while both metrics are important:</P>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance (60%)</strong> (actual correct answers) matter more because it demonstrates skill or knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy (40%)</strong> is rewarded for the predictive value and adds an element of strategy to the game, but it’s less critical than actual performance.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Example Calculation</h2>
        <p>Let’s say you play a 10-question game with the following stats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Questions Attempted:</strong> 10</li>
            <li><strong>Predicted Score:</strong> 7</li>
            <li><strong>Actual Score:</strong> 8</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here’s how your composite score is calculated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy Score:</strong>
                <br><code>Accuracy Score = 1 - abs(7 - 8) / 10 = 0.9</code>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Performance Score:</strong>
                <br><code>Performance Score = (8 / 10) × 10 = 8.0</code>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Composite Score:</strong>
                <br><code>Composite Score = (0.9 × 0.4) + (8.0 × 0.6) = 0.36 + 4.8 = 5.16</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Important Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can only play each question set size (e.g., 10, 15, etc.) once.</li>
            <li>Choose your predicted score carefully—it affects your leaderboard ranking!</li>
            <li>Have fun, and don’t forget to get to know your leadership team better!</li>
        </ul>
